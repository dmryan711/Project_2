                                  <p>New York is home to very many private schools and they are extremely competitive academically. Many also have stringent acceptance procedures, so waiting lists can be long and prospective students must often pass academic tests and interviews. The process can be daunting, and some parents hire private school consulting agencies to increase their child’s chances of getting into the top schools In general, the standard of education at private schools tends to be better than at the average public school. 
                                    <br><br>Private schools also tend to have state-of-the-art facilities that allow their students to pursue extra-curricular activities such as sport and music to a higher level. 
                                      <br><br>The downside to private school education in New York is the high costs. Expat parents will also need to budget for other costs such as uniforms, textbooks, extra-curricular classes and field trips.</p>

                                  <p>A parochial school is a private primary or secondary school maintained and supported by a religious body, such as Roman Catholic parishes, Protestant churches or Jewish organizations.  Parochial schools are separate from the public school system and religious instruction is included in the curriculum.  Schools attached to Roman Catholic parishes make up the largest number of parochial schools.

                            <p>For such a cosmopolitan hub, New York has a surprisingly limited choice of international schools. But perhaps this is to be expected. Language is after all not a barrier, and the curriculum is broadly similar to that which you will find in Britain. So plenty of expats opt to send their offspring to the city’s many excellent and even famous private schools, while a good number plump for the public sector, which, at elementary level at least, has greatly improved.

                                <br><br>So the first decision you will make when relocating to Manhattan is whether to go the usual expat route and send your children to one of the city’s handful of international schools, or, instead, compete for a place at a local private or public school. </p>

                      <p>Public schools are tuition free schools funded and operated by three levels of government:  the United States Department of Education on the federal level, the state-level departments, and the local school district level.  The New York City Department of Education (DOE) operates the largest school district in the United States, serving 1.1 million students in over 1,800 schools.
